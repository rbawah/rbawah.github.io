My name is Rashid Bawah:

- I am obsessed with security-first development.
- I can't seem to pick between OOP and functional programming.
- I use whatever tool does best at solving the problem.

What else do you need to know?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you go on and surf this website and pick up the bits about me? Also, I invite you to visit and hang out with me on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFMwPYpRntd_S6jj4XOLZBA). Not enough? Check out [my profile on github](https://github.com/rbawah), and **all** your questions may finally be answered. And oh, I almost forgot - I have a [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rashidbawah/) as well...and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RashidBawah)
